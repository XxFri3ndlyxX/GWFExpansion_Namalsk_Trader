DayZ Expansion Experimental Namalsk Market Trader

In this zip file you will be provided map files for the Expansion Experimental Market trader objects and map files for trader npcs. For the spawnzone of vehicles, aircrafts and boats, MarketSetting.json is provided but if you don't want to replace it then just get the coordinate from LandSpawnPositions, AirSpawnPositions and WaterSpawnPositions.

Make sure to edit the trader npc so they don't look all the same or keep them wearing all the same clothes. Up to you!
